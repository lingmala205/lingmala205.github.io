					<h1>High Fantasy Languages</h1>
					<!-- Quenya -->
					<h2>Quenya</h2>
					
						<div class = "quenyaText">
							Since his early years, professor and philologist J.R.R. Tolkien loved to create languages.
							In 1910, he started to develop Quenya, inspired by Finnish, when he was in school. It is notable that he first constructed the basic grammar, 
							vocabulary, the script and its stylings, and then he built his stories around his languages. Quenya is one
							of the Elvish languages spoken by the Elves who dwell in Tolkien's Arda, the world in which Middle-earth exists. Tolkien not only
							developed the language, but he also created the internal history of how the language was developed
							by the Elves who came into being by the grace of Eru, the highest god in his legendarium. The Eldor, Noldor,
							and the Vanyar clans of 'High Elves' spoke Quenya, and they went to live in Valinor, in the Undying Lands where only immortals
							were allowed to live. However, the Noldor returned to Middle-earth, where they started to speak Sindarin while they used 
							Quenya for ritualistic purposes. Hence, the usage of Quenya decreased in Middle-earth, and diverged from the Valinor dialect.
							Quenya has a large presence in the Lord of the Rings books, as well as <i>The Silmarillion</i>, Tolkien's posthumously published
							work. A poem written by Tolkien, <i>Nam&#225;ri&#235;</i>, is the most extensive writing in Quenya he created. 
							
						</div>
						
							
						
						<!-- Sindarin -->
						<h3>Sindarin</h3>
						<div class="sindarinText">
							Sindarin is another Elvish language created by Tolkien. It was spoken by the elves in the 
							Western Middle-earth regions. It is also spoken prominently in Peter Jackson's film adaptations
							of Tolkien's books. Sindarin also has its own internal history of its conception, development, and 
							influence in Middle-earth. It was epsecially spoken in Imladris, which is called Rivendell in the Common Speech (English).
							The Tengwar script, another Tolkien creation, is used to write Sindarin, Quenya, and other Elvish languages.
							Tolkien created Sindarin with inspiration from the Welsh language, as well as influences from Old Norse, Old English and Icelandic.
							The song featured on this webpage is sung in Sindarin, with vocals by the Irish singer Enya.

						<!-- Dovahzul -->
						<h4>Dovahzul</h4>
						<div class ="dovahzulText">
							The language of the dragons featured in the <i>Skyrim</i> game was created by <i>Skyrim</i> designer
							and writer Emil Pagliarulo. The script for Dovahzul itself was inspired by Sumerian cuneiform, wedge-shaped
							impressions made on a surface to create visual imagery for communication. The Dovahzul writing is said to resemble
							scratch marks that are carved into rock. Officially, the language lacks a name; it was given the name Dovahzul, or 'dragon-voice',
							by fans of the games. It is also simply called Dovah, or 'dragon' in the imaginary language.
							
						</div>
						
						<!-- High Valyrian -->
						<h5>High Valyrian</h5>
						<div class="valyrianText">
							The language of Old Valyria and House Targaryen is featured promiently on the 'Game of Thrones' TV show.
							The language was created by linguist David J. Peterson for the show specifically; George R. R. Martin, by Peterson's
							account, was "not very interested in the linguistic aspect of his works." Phrases such as <i>Valar morghulis</i> ("all men must die") and 
							<i>Valar dohaeris</i> ("all men must serve") already existed; Peterson built upon those phrases and created the grammar, vocabulary and phonology
							of the language. Daenerys Targaryen, a main charachter of the franchise, frequently converses in High Valyrian with people in Essos. 
							Peterson also created the Dothraki language for the show; this language is spoken by the semi-nomadic Dothraki people of Essos. High Valyrian
							has numerous resources for people wishing to learn it, including a language-learning app. Learning this language is truly a remarkable feat,
							and many are doing so as the HBO hit series progresses.

						<!-- Rohirric (Old English) -->
						<h6>Rohirric (Old English)</h6>
						<div class ="rohirricText">
							Unlike most languages he used in his works, Tolkien never actually created Rohirric, 
							a language of the Kingdom of Rohan in Middle-earth. Instead, he used an existing language for the people 
							of Rohan to speak. Specifically, he used the Mercian dialect of Old English, an early historical
							form of the modern-day English language that we know. Old English was brought to Roman Britain around
							the 5th century by the Anglo-Saxons, a West Germanic group originating from modern day Germany and 
							the Netherlands. Its grammar strongly resembles the grammar of modern-day German. The alphabet had letters
							such as "&#7545;", "&#254;" and "&#240;", unkown to most English speakers today. The image of the the text above, taken from the Old English epic <i>Beowulf</i>, reads "ofer hron rade". The literal translation
							is "over the whale's road", but it is understood to describe a journey over a large body of water, such as
							an ocean. This literary device is called a 'kenning', which is often found to be employed in old works of 
							Old English as well as Old Norse. The concept of a kenning relies on using different words to describe something
							familiar to the words used. For example, "tube box" can mean "television", or "fire ball" can mean "the Sun".
							As for the <i>Beowulf</i> text, the "whale's road" is the "ocean". Old English changed dramatically after the Norman invasions of 1066.
							It became influenced by Latin and early French grammar, as evidenced by people starting to say "chamber" instead of "room", or
							"converse" instead of "speak". A table showing the differences between Old and Modern English words is shown below:
