							J.R.R. Tolkien, a veteran of the First World War and a professor at the 
							University of Oxford, started his magnum opus with him creating Elvish languages
							and then writing his stories around them. He published <i>The Hobbit</i> in 1937.
							It was considered a children's fairytale novel, although Tolkien stated otherwise. 
							After the Second World War, Toklien wrote and published 
							<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, the sequels to <i>The Hobbit</i>, in the 1950s.
							The books were <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, <i>The Two Towers</i>, and <i>The Return of the King</i>.
							By the 1960s, millions  of people had become familiar with the epic quest undertaken by the Hobbits
							to destroy the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. Readers also marveled at legendary
							characters such as Gandalf the Grey, Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and the sinister Gollum.

						<!-- Malazan -->
						<h3>The Malazan Series</h3>
						<div class="malazanText">
							The collaboration between Steven Erikson and Ian C. Esselmont has yielded one of the
							richest works of high fantasy to ever exist in the modern world. This series
							has each of the two authors helming one set of novels which complement each 
							other fully. Erikson's <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> and Esselmont's 
							<i>Novels of the Malazan Empire</i> have thrilled readers since the the first book
							was released in 1999. In this franchise, mages, humans, non-humans and celestial beings all
							struggle to hold their own while the Malazan Empire falls into chaos wrought by centuries of strife.
							Erikson has also written a prequel series to the franchise called <i>The Kharkanas Trilogy</i>, 
							and is, as of March 2019, writing a sequel series called <i>The Witness Trilogy</i>.

						<!-- Narnia -->
						<h4>The Chronicles Of Narnia</h4>
						<div class ="narniaText">
							C.S. Lewis based his masterpiece on Christian allegory, with every book bringing
							its own charm to the series. The first book published, <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>,
							is arguably the most famous book in the franchise. During the outbreak of the Second World War,
							the four Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy) are sent to Professor Kirke's home in the
							English countryside to be safe from the Blitz. While there, Lucy discovers a room containing only a wardrobe. She opens the
							wardrobe and steps into a magical, wondrous world full of fantastical creatures and dangers. The
							children are destined to shape Narnia, with the guidance of Aslan, the noble lion who is the savior of the land.
							The books have been read by people of all faiths and all walks of life.
							The world of Narnia is enjoyed by both young and old, all wanting to step through the 
							wardrobe and into the magical world of their greatest dreams.

						<!-- Discworld -->
						<h5>Discworld</h5>
						<div class ="discworldText">
							In the vast void that is the universe, there is a flat plate, or disc, that is supported
							by four elephants all standing on a giant sea turtle swimming through the cosmos.
							On it, wizards, witches, great cities, trolls, inventors, dwarves and even gods exist 
							while parodying almost every trope of high fantasy, politics and science. In Terry Pratchett's 
							large book franchise, nothing is spared in terms of satire; comedy is pushed to new heights
							and readers will be left laughing hysterically. Rincewind, a wizard and the main protagonist,
							winds his way through life with neither skill nor courage to guide him; yet, he is forced
							into nerve-wracking and hilarious misadventures while trying to save the Discworld simultaneously.
							The series also has other books that focus entirely on other characters, and all of them tell
							stories of the distinctive and downright funny affairs of the Discworld.

						<!-- TheWheelOfTime -->
						<h6>The Wheel of Time</h6>
						<div class ="wheelText">
							Robert Jordan's <i>Wheel of Time</i> series is considered an absolute
							necessity to read for any sort of reader, regardless if they are a fan of 
							high fantasy or not. The story takes place both in our world's past as well
							as its future. A god, the Creator, created the universe as well as the Wheel of Time. The Wheel 
							spins and ushers in every era of history, with the lives of living beings as threads.
							One man learns of his destiny as the savior who will vanquish the most evil being, the Dark One, in existence. 
							However, as he strives to save the world, he must be certain not to destroy it, and he cannot do it alone. He must take
							the guidance and alliance of the entire world to save it for posterity. Layers of magic and gods all enrich the epic tale
							along the way.

						<div class ="truthText">
							Terry Goodkind weaves together an epic narrative that keeps the reader reading
							for hours on end. The world is divided into two halves, the New World and the Old World.
							The New World itself is further divided into three areas: Westland, D'Hara and the Midlands.
							A Westlander named Richard Cypher finds his life permanently altered after the D'Haran Empire 
							invades the Westland and his father's life is taken. Shortly afterwards, he meets a woman named Kahlan Amnell,
							a Confessor, a magical female who is able to make someone utterly devoted to them for the sake of
							finding the truth. Richard learns that he must become a Seeker of Truth, wielding magic and maintaining justice for all.

							George R. R. Martin sends us to the land of Westeros, where seasons are long and where powerful noble families 
							jockey for power and control over the Seven Kingdoms.
							The North, the northernmost kingdom, is ruled by Eddard 'Ned' Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
							House Stark has ruled from the castle of Winterfell for approximately 8000 years. They are responsible for maintaining the Wall,
							a massive ice structure that serves as the northern border of the realm, ostensibly to keep out people who are called
							'wildlings'. King Robert Baratheon, the ruler of all Seven Kingdoms and Ned's good friend, journeys to Winterfell from King's Landing
							to ask him to become Hand of the King, the seniormost advising post in service to the throne.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea in Essos, 
							Daenerys and Viserys Targaryen long to return to Westeros to reclaim what they see as their rightful throne. While the families all vie 
							for control over the realm, they are unaware of a cold, dark, ancient, long-forgotten evil that is starting to return with the coming winter...

						<div class ="mistbornText">
							Brandon Sanderson's trilogy is considered by many to be a truly epic series.
							In the world of Scadrial, ruin reigns. The sky rains ash continuously, the flora 
							is monochromatic, and mists envelop everything at night. The world became this way as
							a result of the the actions of the Hero, who defeated a threat known as the Deepness a millenium ago.
							The Hero then styled himself as the "Lord Ruler", ruling his Final Empire as a terrifying deity. He splits
							society into two groups: the nobility, who support him, and the skaa (the pauper class), who are cruelly oppressed.
							Allomancy, a type of magic, can be accessed by users who swallow and "burn" metals, thereby aquiring magical abilities.
							While Allomancy does occur among the skaa, it is more common among the nobility. Mistborn are extremely rare Allomancers who are able to 
							harness all powers offered by Allomancy. The protagonist finds out that he is a Mistborn, escapes prison, and sets off to defeat
							the Final Empire.
