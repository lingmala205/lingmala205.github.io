In this project, every page contains three JavaScript features: the date, a time stamp for the last time the page was updated,
and tooltips to briefly explain what each page is about.

The navigation menu moves with the page, allowing users to click on another link with ease without having to scroll back up.
When hovered over, the links become red and their immediate background becomes bright yellow in order to help the words stand out against 
the general color.

On every page except "Major Themes and Concepts", "Notable Authors" and "Fantasy Club Membership and Contact", there is 
background music from major film, TV and video game high fantasy franchises playing. There are audio controls for the user 
to use for the background music.

The credits for the background music and images are in the HTML comments.

The page "Notable Authors" has a multimedia video of J.R.R. Tolkien talking about the Middle-earth lore he created. The same page
also features a list of languages that he created (some of which are well-constructed, others have only a few words that exist).

There is a table on the "Learn High Fantasy Languages" page which compares words from Old English to words of modern-day English. The
same page also has links to sites that provide lessons for learning the featured languages.

On the "Fantasy Club Membership and Contact" page, there is a contact information box which has a phone number and email address
that are solely for show; they are not authentic pieces of communication. Hence, you cannot actually dial the number or send an
email to the email address in the contact box.
