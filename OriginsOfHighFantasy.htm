						<div class = "intro">
							Fantasy has been present since humanity first came into existence. 
							Ancient folktales from India and China were told orally, and often 
							told of the the heoric actions of a few special or supernatural individuals, be they
							people or animals. Epics such as The Epic of Gilgamesh <i>(pictured above)</i>, 
							the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are described by some as being some of 
							the earliest stories which incorporated elements of fantasy into their 
							narratives. Greek mythology was also influential in the development of
							fantasy; the tales of  many powers of the gods and goddesses that dwelled 
							on Mount Olympus continue to enthrall scholars, artists and storytellers to this 
							day. The old Norse religion futher popularized the concepts of gods, spirits 
							and many realms of magic where powerful beings existed while all being linked together.
							The Old English epic, Beowulf, is the best known work of Anglo-Saxon literature, and
							has influenced the modern English language as well as the development of the 
							concept of heroes.

						<h3>Emergence of High Fantasy</h3>
						<div class="emergence">
							19th Century classics, such as <i>The Well at the World's End</i>,
							<i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, and <i>The Jungle Book</i> all
							opened the gates for more fantastical stories. <i>Weird Tales</i>, the 
							first magazine that featured solely fantasy stories, was published in 1923.
							J.R.R. Tolkien, a professor at the University of Oxford, wrote 
							<i>The Hobbit</i> and published it on 21 September, 1937. This novel, originally meant for
							children, went on to have sequels in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, which were 
							published in the 1950s. Tolkien is widely credited to have created
							modern high fantasy, having created entire languages from scratch for his work.
							C.S. Lewis, a close friend of Tolkien, wrote <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>,
							publishing them from the early to the late 1950s. Many other writers followed
							suit, creating worlds in their brilliant writings, inspiring millions around
							the world to pick up their pens and write, as well.
