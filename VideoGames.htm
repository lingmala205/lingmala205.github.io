						<div class = "skyrimText">
							In a universe where dragons speak their own language, where lizard-men dwell, and where sorcery is
							prevalent in every corner of the world, the gamer is thrust into one of the greatest
							game series ever created. In the Elder Scrolls, humans, elves, and orcs all have cities
							and politics that rules them. Other non-human races, such as the Khajit and Argonians,
							display animal-like qualities that aid them in their daily lives. Organized religions, cultures,
							and other communities all shape the lore and the setting of Tamriel, the continent featured prominently
							in the games. Tamriel has nine unique regions, with a unique race living in each of them. 
							The protagonist must learn skills to advance in the world, with a wide array of magic, books
							and other obecjtives to learn, read from and complete. Jeremy Soule, a critically acclaimed
							music composer, has scored the main Elder Scrolls games since 2002. With Soule's original 
							score, featured on this page, open world immersion gameplay, and high-level digital graphics, <i>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</i> game, along with 
							the franchise itself, has been lauded as the greatest video game(s) in recent years, revolutionizing
							game development, gameplay, and entertainment.

						<!-- Dark Souls -->
						<h3>The Dark Souls Franchise</h3>
						<div class="soulsText">
							Created by Hidetaka Miyazaki and FromSoftware, the <i>Souls</i> franchise is one of the most critically
							acclaimed video game franchises of all time. The player is able to create a character
							from scratch, giving it whataver name, gender, and class desired. The classes are Knight,
							Barbarian, Thief, and Mage. Abilities showcased by the character may be modified according
							to in-game choices that have been made. The player is able to gain souls in order to equip their
							arsenal as well as receive increases in experience to raise their levels. The franchise is both 
							lauded and slightly criticized for its difficulty, with <i>Dark Souls III</i> being famous
							for having incredibly complex fights. The games have spawned a comic book and a board game, as well.
							The franchise's music, written by Motoi Sakuraba, is also regarded as a spectacular work of art.

						<!-- World of Warcraft -->
						<h4>World of Warcraft (WoW)</h4>
						<div class ="warcraftText">
							The World of Azeroth beckons! In what is Blizzard Entertainment's most famous
							work, the <i>Warcraft</i> franchise has made MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online
							roleplaying games) a mainstream wonder. Massive tournaments are held worldwide, and
							novels, comics, board games, card games, manga and even a film all based on the game
							are enjoyed by millions. Azeroth is one of many planets featured prominently in the games.
							It features four continents which are called the Eastern Kingdoms. Players get to participate
							in journeying on quests, engaging in combat with mythical and fantastic monsters, and
							expanding their 'skill tree' to gain experience and become stronger. As more titles have been
							released, the <i>Warcraft</i> universe has expanded exponentially. The lore and the art becomes richer
							and the poularity of the game increases.

						<h5>The Legend of Zelda</h5>
						<div class ="zeldaText">
							In what is arguably one of Nintendo's most famous game franchises, <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>
							focuses on an elf named Link who often has to save the Kingdom of Hyrule and Princess Zelda. 
							He must also fight numerous enemies, epecially Ganon, a demon who is his main foe. Link
						    has had many versions of his character over the years, and has been tasked with keeping the Triforce of
							Courage, one of three extremely powerful objects left in the world by three goddesses who
							personified three qualities: Power, Courage, and Wisdom. Princess Zelda is the keeper of the Triforce
							of Wisdom, while Ganon usually has the Triforce of Power. Ganon, being the villain he is, desires the two other
							Triforces for his personal gain. If someone manages to unite the three Triforces, the user becomes omnipotent. Since 1986, 
							nineteen games have been released featuring the adventures of Zelda and Link, including an American television series and
							a plethora of Japnese manga series.
