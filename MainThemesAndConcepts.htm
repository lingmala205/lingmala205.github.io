						<div class = "magicText">
							Magic is one of the most famous concepts used in high fantasy.
							Be they protagonists or antagonists, a plethora of characters
							wield supernatural powers and boast tremendous mystical strength.
							Magic is used prominently by wizards, mages, sorcerers, and even
							celestial beings. These unique powers may be used for attack, defense, healing
							and even learning. Physical places in high fantasy works may also
							possess magical power; ancient forests may have sentient trees, and
							majestic citadels could have spells cast over them for protection against
							external threats attempting to penetrate its ramparts, with the enchantments
							etched into their stone.
						</div>

						<!-- Wizardds -->
						<h3>Wizards</h3>
						<div class="wizardText">
							Wizards, also called mages or sorcerers, are notable characters in high fantasy. 
							They frequently use magic to solve problems and to aid in combat. Wizards are 
							sometimes also able to traverse space and time and create entire dimensions 
							outside of reality. Wizards have been portrayed as ancient, wise, scholarly 
							and capable of controlling the weather and understanding animals to an extent. Saruman, 
							an Istar (wizard) from <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> books, 
							is able to understand crows and makes lightning strike a snowy mountain in Peter Jackson's 
							film adaptations.

						<!-- Elves -->
						<h4>Elves</h4>
						<div class ="elvesText">
							Elves are inherently magical creatures, immortal and extremely powerful. They are
							usually portrayed as humanoids of divine origin who are in harmony with nature and
							having unmatched beauty. They have distinct, pointed ears which distinguish them from 
							most other races in high fantasy. The elves created by J.R.R. Tolkien were the first children
							of Eru Il&#250;vatar, the Celestial being who created the world of Middle-earth. Tolkien's elves do not 
							suffer from disease and are naturally immortal.	Elves can also be portrayed as having their 
							own languages, such	as Sindarin and Quenya.
						</div>

						<!-- Dwarves -->
						<h5>Dwarves</h5>
						<div class ="dwarvesText">
							Dwarves are a race of short, humanoid creatures. They are often portrayed as 
							dwelling deep in the mountains, working as expert blacksmiths, miners, and 
							jewelers. However, they are highly capable of fierce combat, and are incredibly loyal
							to their allies. Dwarves in both <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> and <i>The Hobbit
							and the Lord of the Rings</i> served their leaders and allies faithfully, as seen
							with the dwarves that side with Aslan, and Gimli's strong friendship with Legolas, respectively.

						<!-- Dragons -->
						<h6>Dragons</h6>
						<div class ="dragonsText">
							Dragons are famous creatures in high fantasy. Their abilities of breathing fire, flight,
							and sheer raw power have made them the one of the most recognizable mythical creatures
							of all time. Dragons are frequently being depicted as scaly, horned and flying lizard beings
							who wreak havoc on cities and empires, but can also be depicted as sentient beings
							who are compassionate towards other beings, such as dragons in many Asian mythologies.

						<div class="creaturesHeading">
						Other Creatures
						</div>
						
						<div class ="creaturesText">
							Ents, pictured here, are treelike sheperds of the forests in Middle-earth. Orcs are cruel, hideous,
							violent beings who appear in many works of high fantasy, doing their master's bidding.
							There are great eagles who save the protagonists from death, ghosts who haunt the mountains,
							and gods who rule over multiple universes and who even fight each other. The types of 
							fantasy creatures that exist are only limited by one's imagination.

						<!-- The Quest -->
						<div class="questHeading">
						The Quest
						</div>
						
						<div class ="questText">
							In high fantasy, the 'good vs. evil' dichotomy is often employed to give
							the good protagonist a sense of purpose and defeat the sinister threats
							that lurk in the shadows. The protagonist's mission is usually a journey,
							or quest, which involves many members united by a common cause travelling far
							and wide to bring peace in their time.
						</div>
						
							<div class="quest">

							</div>
						
						<!-- The Quest -->
						<div class="worldHeading">
						World Building
						</div>
						
						<div class ="worldText">
							For the vast majority of high fantasy works, the universe that inhabits
							the stories are as integral to them as the characters are. Magnificent, sprawling cities
							and legions of brave warriors defending them immediately conjures excitement and wonder
							simultaneously. The sleepy, charming villages of the Shire filled with sweet aromas and
							joyous laughter paints a delightful image in our minds. Reading is an adventure in itself,
							and when you read high fantasy, one believes that they dwell in the same world which they are
							reading about. Populating a story with a universe that gives eagerness, thrill, awe and 
							many other emotions life defines the genius of many high fantasy writers.
