						<div class = "lotrText">
							Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on Tolkien's books 
							revitalized the high fantasy genre and revolutionized the motion picture industry. 
							The films, <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, <i>The Two Towers</i>, and 
							<i>The Return of the King</i>, were filmed from 1999 to 2000 and released between 
							2001 and 2003, inclusive. With Howard Shore's unique and mesmerizing score, cutting-edge 
							visual effects at the time, and spectacular cinematography, the LOTR film trilogy
							collectively won 17 Academy Awards out of 30 they were nominated for.
							<i>The Return of the King</i> won all 11 Academy Awards it was nominated for, a rare feat.
							Howard Shore won 'Best Original Score' twice for the first and third films in the trilogy,
							while also winning 'Best Original Song' for 'Into the West' with Annie Lennox and Fran Walsh.
							Jackson won 'Best Director' for <i>The Return of the King</i>, as well as 'Best Adapted Screenplay'
							with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens and 'Best Picture' with Barrie M. Osborne and Fran Walsh.
							The trilogy was also financially successful, with <i>The Return of the King</i> earning more than
							$1 billion at the box office. The films collectively made $2,917,506,956.

						<h3>The Hobbit</h3>
						<div class="hobbitText">
							Peter Jackson helmed the prequel trilogy of his critically and financially successful
							LOTR trilogy. Based on Tolkien's 1937 novel, Jackson reassembled most of his original crew
							and some of his original cast from the early 2000s. Howard Shore returned to compose the score. Ian McKellen returned as Gandalf,
							Hugo Weaving returned as Elrond, Sir Christopher Lee returned as Saruman, and Cate Blanchett 
							returned as Lady Galadriel. <i>An Unexpected Journey</i> was released in 2012, <i>The Desolation of Smaug</i> 
							was released in 2013, and <i>The Battle of the Five Armies</i> was released in 2014. While this trilogy 
							is not as critically lauded as its predecessor trilogy, it nevertheless made $2.93 billion at the box office.
							<i>An Unexpected Journey</i> won a special Scientific and Engineering Academy Award in 2013.

							<i>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</i>. These three films have collectively made $1,580,364,900
							at the box office. It is widely considered that the first film is the most well done of
							the three. In 2018, it was announced that Netflix would be making a TV adaptation of the original series
