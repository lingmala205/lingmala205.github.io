						<div class = "tolkienText">
							John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, in the British colony of the Orange Free State
							(present-day South Africa) in 1892. His family moved to England when he was four years old, and he grew
							up in the Catholic faith. Tolkien studied Anglo-Saxon and Germanic literature at Exeter College at the University of Oxford. He joined the
							British Royal Armed Forces in 1915 during the First World War, and he saw action in the Somme. 
							He had married his wife, Edith, in 1916, and he was medically discharged from the military afterwards.
							Tolkien went on to become a professor at the University of Leeds in 1920, and
							then joined the faculty at Oxford, his alma mater. He became friends with C.S. Lewis, author of <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>.
							Tolkien went on to write and publish <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. His experiences from war greatly shaped the fantasay and the battles that were
							featured in his work. He continued to expand his pioneering legendarium with his constructed languages and multilayered lore 
							(some of which he talks about below) before passing away in 1973 at	the age of 81.

						<h3>C.S. Lewis</h3>
						<div class="cslText">
							Clive Staples Lewis was born in 1898 in Belfast, Ireland.
							He loved reading as a child, and had a fascination with mythology. He became an atheist after leaving his parents' Christian
							faith, and moved to England when he was still young. He enrolled at Oxford in 1917 after winning a scholarship,
							but he was drafted into the British Army and served in the First World War. He credited the atrocities of the 
							war, along with his mother's death, as his reasons for his atheism. Lewis became a faculty member at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1925. 
							He met and became close friends with J.R.R. Tolkien around 1926, with whom he had various discussions and arguments about religion. 
							Through these discussions, Lewis returned to Christianity by 1931. He converted to Anglicanism to Tolkien's disappointment; 
							the latter had wished for Lewis to become a Catholic. C.S. Lewis remained a 
							devout Anglican for the rest of his life, writing various works about his faith. He wrote and published <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>,
							widely considered a paragon of allegory, in the 1950s. He passed away at the age of 64 in 1963.

						<h4>Steven Erikson</h4>
						<div class ="eriksonText">
							Born Steve Rune Lundin in 1959 in Toronto, Canada, this acclaimed author uses a pseudonym
							for his critically celebrated works. Erikson studied at the University of Iowa and worked 
							as an anthropologist and archaeologist. Together with his close friend and colleague Ian C.
							Esselmont (<i>not pictured</i>), Erikson created one of the richest and extensive works of high
							fantasy in modern times. His <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> series, along with Esselmont's equally
							essential <i>Novels of the Malazan Empire</i> series, has catapulted high fantasy to soaring levels of 
							popularity. Erikson also wrote a prequel trilogy to the series called <i>The Kharkanas Trilogy</i>,
							and is currently working on a sequel trilogy called <i>The Witness Trilogy</i>.

							Terry Pratchett
						</div>
						<div class ="pratchettText">
							Sir Terence David John Pratchett was born in Buckinghamshire, England, UK, in 1948. He was interested in astronomy 
							and science fiction at an early age. He remained fascinated with astronomy throught his life, even having a 
							telescope in his backyard. When he was seveen years old, Pratchett started his first job in journalism.
							He worked in the newspaper industry from the 1970s to the late 1980s. He left his job to become a writer after the 
							start of his famous <i>Discworld</i> series began taking off. The first book, <i>The Color of Magic</i>, was released in
							1983. Pratchett continued to write and publish forty-one books in total for <i>Discworld</i>, with and average of one or more
							annually by the dawn of the 21st century. In his novels, everything imaginable is satirized and parodied,
							ranging from human behavior and religion to the concept of life and science. His books have spawned television shows, video games, and even plays. He also wrote
							several novels for children, such as the <i>Bromeliad</i> and the <i>Johnny Maxwell</i> trilogies. In 2007, Pratchett
							was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. That did not stop him from becoming an activist for Alzheimer's awareness and donating
							much of his wealth to fund research related to the disease. He also became an English professor at the University of Dublin in 2010.
							Pratchett continued to publish books until he passed away in 2015 at the age of 66. His final Discworld novel, <i>The Shepherd's Crown</i>,
							was released posthumously that same year.

						<div class ="martinText">
							George Raymond Martin was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, U.S.A. in 1948. His second middle name,
							Richard, is his confirmation name which he added when he was thirteen years old. Martin describes himself
							as a "lapsed Catholic". He attended Northwestern University for both his bachelor's and master's degrees in 
							journalism. From the age of twenty-one, Martin professionally wrote and sold short stories in science fiction.
							He also wrote the screenplays for a number of television shows, most notably a 1989 adaptation of the fairtytale
							<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i> He is best known, however, for his epic series <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>. 
							<i>A Game of Thrones</i>, the first book in the series, was published in 1996. Five books have been published so far.
							Two more novels are expected to be released.
							HBO started producing <i>Game of Thrones</i> in 2011, with Martin serving as an executive producer. He also serves 
							as a consultant to approve every episode and ensuring it stays as faithful as possible to his source material.
							However, Martin has stated that the show, which ends in 2019, will have a somewhat different ending from his book
							series, so as to keep the conclusion a surprise. Martin has won many awards for both his writing and showrunning.
							He continues to write additional stories, with praise from all over.
