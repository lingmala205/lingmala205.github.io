						<div class = "gotText">
							The HBO adaptation of George R. R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" 
							series is one of the most famous and acclaimed shows on television. The musical score, composed by Ramin Djawadi, 
							has some of the most recognizable themes in popular music, many of which are playing on this page.
							With Sean Bean as Ned Stark, Kit Harington as Jon Snow, and Peter Dinklage
							as Tyrion Lannister, the characters have become household names and their quotes
							have become equally famous. One particular example is "Winter is coming", the words
							of House Stark which are said often on the show. Showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff 
							are brilliant in managing show, of which George R. R. Martin 
							is also an executive producer who approves every episode. The show has garnered many accolades
							over its entire run. Peter Dinklage has won the Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor three times
							for the first, fifth and seventh seasons. The show itself has won the Outstanding Drama Series Emmy
							Award three times. The series has also won many other acting, directing, writing, cinematography, and
							music awards. The eighth and final season is set to premiere in April 2019.

						<h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender (ATLA)</h3>
						<div class="atlaText">
							This Nickleodeon children's show has won many awards and has been described by many viewers, both young and old,
							to be incredibly sophisticated and insightful in its themes and concepts. It is set in a world
							where certain people known as 'benders' are able to control the four elements of nature: Water,
							Earth, Fire, and Air. Each element is used by four different nations. For a long time, the four nations
							coexisted peacefully; however, the Fire Nation suddenly launched an imperialistic attack against the world,
							wanting to cement dominion over all people. The Avatar, the only bender who could control all four elements,
							could end the conflict, but the being disappeared at the hour of need. A century later, Katara, a waterbender,
							and her older brother, Sokka (a non-bender), discover a boy and his sky bison in an iceberg, apparently hibernating.
							When the boy, Aang, wakes up, the two Water Tribe siblings discover that he is an airbender and the new Avatar. Aang comes 
							to realize that the Fire Nation had wiped out his fellow Air Nomads in a genocide which was perpetrated shortly after he was 
							frozen. With the war still raging after 100 years, Aang must now learn to master the three remaining elements. 
							In doing so, he must fulfill his destiny as the Avatar along with his friends to defeat the Fire Nation and end the Hundred Year War.

						<h4>The Legend of Korra (LoK)</h4>
						<div class ="korraText">
							Set 70 years after the events of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, this sequel series follows
							the story of Korra, the new Avatar and a young woman from the Southern Water Tribe. This stubborn
							waterbender must learn the ways of a tough world in Republic City, a sprawling metropolis which
							is home to millions of people from all walks of life, both bender and non-bender. Her airbending master, Tenzin,
							is the son of Avatar Aang and wants Korra to learn patience and discipline herself to learn
							airbending, her weakest element. She meets Mako (a firebender) and Bolin (an earthbender), two orphaned brothers her age 
							who grew up on the street and who love the probending sport. She also meets Asami Sato, the daughter of an industrial tycoon. Together, the four form a
							strong friendship and team up to face the new dangers that threaten the world. Both <i>Korra</i> and its predecessor
							draw strong inspiration from Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and Inuit cultures, and introduce topics such as terrorism,
							politics, race, and even sexual themes to children in a manner which many praise as educated, mature and responsible. This
							series has also won many awards for its animation and voice acting and has won praise for its score.
